# Second Milestone

My Second Milestone was coding the ardino to take inputs from buttons and potentiometers into MIDI. I used this [code](https://github.com/silveirago/DIY-Midi-Controller) to take the button presses into outputs ready for the [serial to MIDI converter](https://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial). After converting the serial output to MIDI I had to use a [virutal MIDI port](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) to receive these outputs.


# First  Milestone

My first Milestone was planning out the layout of the MIDI controller and starting to mess with the components of my project. Initally I was confused on how each component worked but after doing some reasearch I learned how to wire up a potentiometer and a button. During this Milestone I also learned about Arduinos and how to write basic ardino code. This week was important to learn the basics and to become aware of all components in my kit.
