# Final Milestone

My Final Milestone was cutting out the holes and slits to fit all the components. This step was quite challenging as I didnt  have a large enough drill bit to make the hole required to hold the button so I had to do a lot of filing to make the hole large enough. After cutting and filing all the holes I clicked in the buttons and hot glued the rotatry and slide potentiometers. 

The Next step was to wire all the components to the arduino. I had to do alot of soldering to connect every wire. This took me a while to I enjoyed soldering so I didnt mind it. After soldering all the wires to the components I connected them to the arduino which I also drilled and filed out a port to connect the ardino to my computer.

I had troubles cutting out the layout of the MIDI controller as I had to do lots of filing  and it was not the most fun

# Second Milestone


My Second Milestone was coding the ardino to take inputs from buttons and potentiometers into MIDI. I used this [code](https://github.com/silveirago/DIY-Midi-Controller) to take the button presses into outputs ready for the [serial to MIDI converter](https://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial). After converting the serial output to MIDI I had to use a [virutal MIDI port](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html) to receive these outputs. Once I was sending MIDI controlls to the  virutal MIDI port I used FLStudios to take the MIDI controlls and produce music.

Other things I accomplished during this week was changing into using arcade buttons and learning to use a linear slide potentiometer. Both componets were diffrent from the original componets in the kit. The arcade button had 2 pins instead of 4. The linear slide potentiometer had 6 pins instead of 3. I figured out how to use the arcade buttton pretty quickly but I am still having trouble figuring out how to use the linear slide potentiometer. 

# First  Milestone

My first Milestone was planning out the layout of the MIDI controller and starting to mess with the components of my project. Initally I was confused on how each component worked but after doing some reasearch I learned how to wire up a potentiometer and a button. During this Milestone I also learned about Arduinos and how to write basic ardino code. This week was important to learn the basics and to become aware of all components in my kit.
