# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone



# First  Milestone
[![First Milestone]

My first Milestone was planning out the layout of the MIDI controller and starting to mess with the components of my project. Initally I was confused on how each component worked but after doing some reasearch I learned how to wire up a potentiometer and a button. During this Milestone I also learned about Arduinos and how to write basic ardino code.
